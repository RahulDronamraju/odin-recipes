#The Odin Project: Recipes Project
This project is a web application showcasing various recipes built as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate the following skills:

HTML Structure: Building the basic structure of web pages using HTML elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, and images.
Web Page Organization: Organizing the project with separate HTML files for each recipe and a central index page for navigation.
Understanding of Web Development Concepts: Gaining a foundational understanding of web development principles and technologies.
